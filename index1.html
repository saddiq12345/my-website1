    <p>Do you read the Quran but don’t understand its meaning?<p> Do you wish to interpret the words of Allah (SWT) to abide by them correctly?<p> Have you wondered if there is some guide to decipher the Quranic verses?<p> The answer is “Tafseer Quran”.

        Learning Quran Tafsir is essential to every Muslim in the world,<p> kids or adults, male or female. Even if you are a Muslim living<p>in a non-Arab country like the USA, UK, Canada, Australia, etc, you still can learn Quran online.<p> In this regards, the prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said:
        
        When Allah wishes good for someone, He bestows upon him the understanding of Deen.</p></center>
